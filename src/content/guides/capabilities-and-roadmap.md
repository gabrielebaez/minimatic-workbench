# Minimatic — Capabilities and Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-08-21
**Status:** Assessment of the kernel after the pattern-language and
rewriting work (guards, alternatives, `Hold`/`ReleaseHold`, `:>`, `//.`)
and the `Dict` layer
**Scope:** what the language does today, what it could do once the missing
heads exist, and what would still be missing after that

Every claim here was produced by running the kernel, not by reading the
design docs. Where the two disagree, this document describes the kernel.

---

## 1. Why this document

The design docs describe the language as intended; `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
describes the MVP as shipped; proposal 001 describes a set of corrections.
None of them answers the practical question — *what can you actually write
in Minimatic right now, and what stops you.*

The distinction that organises everything below: **a missing head is an
afternoon's work; a missing core capability is a language change.** Most of
what Minimatic lacks is the former. What it lacks in the latter is small,
specific, and mostly invisible in the docs because the docs describe it as
already working.

---

## 2. What works today

63 registered heads:

```
Args CompoundExpression Dict EmptyQ Err Head Hold Lambda List Range
ReleaseHold ReplaceAll ReplaceRepeated Rule RuleDelayed Set SetDelayed
__pipe__ and append catch divide each equal finally first fold for
from_pairs greater greater_eq has_key if is_err key_drop key_get key_set
keys length less less_eq map map_keys map_values merge minus mod negate not
not_equal or plus power print recover rest switch times to_pairs unwrap
unwrap_err values which
```

Working and covered by 296 tests:

- **Evaluation** — strict, single-pass, `head(args)` all the way down. No
  special forms: `if`/`switch`/`which`/`for`/`each`/`;` are ordinary heads
  that skip branches via their own hold attributes.
- **Dispatch** — specificity-scored, most-specific-first, recursing into
  nested compound patterns. Declaration order breaks only exact ties.
- **Patterns** — blanks, typed blanks (`_int`, `_list`, `_err`, …),
  sequence blanks, named binds, compound patterns whose head is pinned
  literally, alternatives (`_int | _string`), and guards (`/;`) at both
  argument and clause level.
- **Functions** — closures, currying, higher-order use, recursion, mutual
  recursion.
- **Pipes** — `|>` and `//`, with `$` placeholders for argument position;
  `/@` for map.
- **Rewriting** — `/.` and `//.` (to a normal form) over both evaluated
  data and `Hold`-captured code, with immediate (`->`) or delayed (`:>`)
  rules, written out or held in a variable.
- **Errors as values** — `Err(kind, detail)`, pipe short-circuiting,
  `catch`/`recover`/`finally`/`unwrap`/`unwrap_err`/`is_err`. No `Ok`
  wrapper.
- **Dicts** — the `{k -> v}` literal, canonically ordered so equality and
  structural matching agree, plus the ten §6 heads, `length` and `EmptyQ`.
- **Structure inspection** — `Head`, `Args`, total over every value.
- **Host integration** — `register_head`, and Markdown files as runnable
  scripts.

### 2.1 Self-hosting is real

The strongest evidence that the core is sufficient: the derived list layer
can be written *in Minimatic*. These run today.

```
myfold(f: _, i: _, [])              := i
myfold(f: _, i: _, [x: _, r: ___])  := myfold(f, f(i, x), r)

prepend(xs: _list, x: _)            := fold(xs, append, [x])

myfilter(p: _, [])                  := []
myfilter(p: _, [x: _, r: ___])      := if(p(x), prepend(myfilter(p, r), x),
                                             myfilter(p, r))
```

`fold`, `filter`, `take`, `reverse`, `length` and `prepend` all work from
clause dispatch, specificity and sequence patterns alone — the bar
`docs/the prelude.md` §13 sets for whether the core is enough for real list
work. It clears it, subject to §3.2 below.

---

## 3. The core's ceiling

These are the limits that filling in heads will not touch.

### 3.1 Anonymous multi-argument lambdas do not exist

`(a, b) -> a + b` is a `MinimaticSyntaxError`. A *named* two-argument head
works fine as a callback:

```
combine(a: _, b: _) := a * 10 + b
fold([1, 2, 3], combine, 0)          (* 123 *)
```

So the gap is specifically lambda syntax. It affects every callback that
takes two arguments — `fold`, `zip_with`, `sort_by` comparators, `catch`
handlers that want kind and detail separately. This is the largest
expressive limit in the language and among the smallest to fix.

### 3.2 Self-hosted recursion caps out around 200–300 elements

Python's recursion limit is 1000 and there is no tail-call elimination.
Measured with the self-hosted `myfold` above:

| input | result |
|---|---|
| 200 elements | works |
| 400 elements | `RecursionError` |
| builtin `fold`, 2000 elements | works |

So §2.1's self-hosting is genuine but capped at small inputs; anything
sizeable still has to be a Python head. This bounds how much of the Prelude
can honestly move into Minimatic.

`RecursionError` also **escapes `MinimaticError`** — a fourth escaping
class beyond the three proposal 001 Phase C closed. Host code catching "any
Minimatic problem" still misses runaway recursion.

### 3.3 `Attributes(f) := HoldAll` silently does nothing

It looks like it works. It does not. `Attributes` is not a registered head,
so the statement simply defines *a clause named `Attributes`* and sets no
attribute — verified: the head goes on evaluating its arguments, and
`registry.attributes(f)` stays empty.

`docs/the language.md` §10 presents this as *the* way to declare hold
behavior, and states there is "exactly one hold mechanism" available
"identically to user-defined functions and to Python-registered heads".
Today hold attributes are Python-side only: **a Minimatic-level user cannot
write a macro at all.** Failing quietly makes this the worst of the gaps.

### 3.4 ~~No `Hold`~~ — closed

`Hold`, `ReleaseHold`, `:>` and `//.` now ship, so `/.` reaches unevaluated
code as well as data and the design docs' symbolic examples run as written.
What remains a limit is §3.3: rewriting is the *only* way to see an
unevaluated expression, because a Minimatic-level user still cannot declare
a head of their own that holds its arguments.

### 3.5 Smaller core gaps

- **Indexing is unimplemented.** `xs[0]` and `d["k"]` are syntax errors,
  though `docs/the language.md` §6.1 advertises them. It is not just a
  missing head: postfix `[...]` would end the parser's "statements are
  self-delimiting" property, which `parse_all` and every Markdown script
  rely on, so it needs a statement-separator decision first.
- **Sequence blanks only work in final position.** `f(a: __, z: _)` never
  matches — a documented simplification in `match.py`. A sequence blank
  inside an alternation (`__ | _int`) does not match either, for the same
  structural reason.
- **No literal-symbol patterns.** A bare symbol in a pattern always binds,
  which is what blocked symbol-valued `Err` kinds.

---

## 4. Assuming every missing head lands

The head-level gaps are large in volume but ordinary in nature: the entire
string layer, most of the list layer
(`filter`, `sort`, `zip`, `unique`, `group_by`, `find`, `concat`, `take`,
`drop`, …), the meta heads (`MatchQ`, `match`, `Cases`, type predicates),
`and`/`or`/`xor`, the numeric helpers, I/O, and the functional combinators.

**With those in place, Minimatic is a competent strict functional
expression language.** Enough for business rules, validation, config and
DSL evaluation, data transformation over modest collections, and wiring
host Python algorithms together — which is precisely the "knowledge and
computation workbench" the language positions itself as.

**What it still could not do**, because these are §3 and not heads:

| Cannot | Blocked by |
|---|---|
| Write a two-argument callback without naming it | §3.1 |
| Process more than a few hundred elements in Minimatic-level code | §3.2 |
| Define a macro, or any head that sees unevaluated arguments | §3.3 |
| Index a list | §3.5 |

Put plainly: **the Prelude is what stands between Minimatic and being
useful; the §3 gaps are what stand between it and being what its own
documentation already describes.**

---

## 5. Recommended order

1. **Multi-argument lambdas** (§3.1). Smallest change, largest unlock. Do
   it first — otherwise every derived head taking a callback in step 3 gets
   designed around the limitation, and re-designed afterwards.

2. **`Attributes` as a real head** (§3.3). Makes language doc §10 true,
   enables user-level macros, and removes a statement that currently fails
   silently. Small, and it stops the docs lying about a core guarantee.

3. **Prelude build-out.** Strings, the rest of the list layer, type
   predicates, `MatchQ`/`match`/`Cases`. The largest volume of
   work and the most user-visible value, unblocked by (1). Much of it can
   be written in Minimatic per §2.1, within the §3.2 size limit.

4. ~~**`Hold` / `ReleaseHold` / `:>`**~~ **Done.** Both open questions
   were settled in the process: `docs/the language.md` §16.4 (a release
   evaluates in the scope it is released in — `Hold` captures nothing) and
   `docs/the kernel.md` §14.4 (a delayed RHS is never evaluated during
   rewriting, so nothing changes about error identity).

5. **Recursion depth** (§3.2). At minimum convert `RecursionError` into a
   `MinimaticError` so it stops escaping; properly, trampoline self-calls
   so self-hosted list code scales.

Independently: **Phase D of proposal 001** — reconciling
`docs/the language.md`, `docs/the kernel.md` and `docs/the prelude.md` with
what shipped — remains outstanding. Several gaps above are only visible
*as* gaps because those documents describe them as working.

## 6. Reproducing this

```bash
uv run pytest                              # 296 passing
uv run python -m minimatic examples/tour.md
```

Each claim in §2 and §3 was checked by direct `Kernel.eval` probes. The
three worth re-running before trusting this document again:

- the self-hosted `fold`/`filter` definitions in §2.1;
- the 200-versus-400 element recursion boundary in §3.2;
- `Attributes(f) := HoldAll` leaving `registry.attributes(f)` empty (§3.3).
